## About  Project
It is intended to be a standard or development layer for buying and selling projects applicable to any business model.
The project contemplates three roles and an admin

* Salesperson
* Buyer 
* Validator (not included in the scope of the project) 

[ Seller ]

- In order to post products on the platform a collateral must be left as a guarantee. "Register".
This collateral is defined by an administrator and is parameterizable, but it is planned to develop a DAO for a second phase.
- Sellers must qualify their buyers, history (not included in the scope of the project). 

[ Buyer ] 

- Anyone can buy.
- Buyers must qualify sellers, history (not included in project scope). 

[ Administrator ] 

- Change fees 
- Ban accounts 

Validator (not included in the scope of the project) 

- In the next phase it is planned to ask for clarifications, validators will vote to define the situation. 
- You will earn a commission for participating 

### TODO
